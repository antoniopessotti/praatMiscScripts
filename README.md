# praatMiscScripts

#### Collection of miscellaneous scripts for Praat

This repository contains a slowly growing number of scripts to conduct
miscellaneous tasks for which I've missed existing scripts. Please do send me
your comments, suggestions or ideas (you can find my contact details [here][]).

## Script included

* toPraatColour: Two procedures for Praat to convert colours in hexadecimal
or RGB format into Praat's colour format. The procedures are meant to be
inserted in other scripts via `include name_of_file.proc` and then called by
`@name_of_procedure (argument_1...)`.
